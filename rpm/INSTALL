Instructions to create an installation executable for Windows.

  1. Create the distribution for Unix, unpack it on a Linux RedHat 7.0
     machine (may work for other versions too, but it has been tested
     to work only on RH7) and copy this directory (rpm) into the Twelf
     root directory. The instructions below are meant to be executed from
     said Linux machine, logged in as super-user (root).

  2. Edit twelf-1.3.spec to make sure that it reflects the right version
     number and other information.

  3. Copy a (packed) version of the Unix distribution in
     /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES:

       # cp <path>/twelf-1-3.tar.gz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES

  4. Copy the Twelf logo file in that directory too:

       # cp logo.gif /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES

  5. Copy the spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS:

       # cp twelf-1.3.spec /usr/src/redhat/SPECS

  6. Install Twelf in your machine by executing twelf-install:

       # ./twelf-install

  7. Add the list of installed files to the spec file:

       # ./twelf-files >> /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/twelf-1.3.spec

  8. Uninstall Twelf:

       # ./twelf-uninstall

  9. Build the RPMs:

       # rpm -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/twelf-1.3.spec
       # ./twelf-uninstall

     If the RPM build completes successfully, the binary RPM
     will be in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386, and the source RPM
     in /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS.
     Don't forget to clean up the directories
       /usr/src/redhat/BUILD
       /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386
       /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
       /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
       /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS
     after finishing.
