[Twelf](/wiki/about-the-twelf-project/) is a language used to specify,
implement, and prove properties of deductive systems such as programming
languages and logics. [Large research projects using
Twelf](/wiki/research-projects-using-twelf/) include the TALT typed assembly
language, a foundational proof-carrying-code system, and a type safety proof
for Standard ML. Twelf is no longer undergoing active development, but it
retains a community of users and remains a valuable tool for research.

Here's what it looks like to write Twelf:

<Twelf code={`
exp : type.
app : exp -> exp -> exp.
lam : (exp -> exp) -> exp.

step : exp -> exp -> type.
step/app : step (app (lam [x] E0 x) E2) (E0 E2).
`}/>

Here's what it looks like to run Twelf:

<Twelf checked context={`
exp : type.
app : exp -> exp -> exp.
lam : (exp -> exp) -> exp.

step : exp -> exp -> type.
step/app : step (app (lam [x] E0 x) E2) (E0 E2).
`} code={`
omega = app (lam [x] app x x) (lam [x] app x x).
%query 1 1 step omega E.
`}/>

Visitors without a technical background are encouraged to read the [general
description of Twelf](/wiki/general-description-of-twelf/).

- The [installation instructions](/download/) can get you started.
- [Proving metatheorems with Twelf](/wiki/proving-metatheorems-with-twelf/) is
  a mini-course on some of the most common ways of using Twelf.
- The [glossary](/wiki/glossary/) and [documentation hub](/wiki/documentation/)
  are the most up-to-date documentation for Twelf.

This website is home of Twelf language _and_ the home for lots of Twelf-centric
tutorials on logic and programming languages. See the [case studies
hub](/wiki/case-studies/) for more. Don't be shy about
[contributing](/contributing/) to our documentation or adding your own
tutorials or case studies!

This website is still in the process of being converted from the MediaWiki
installation that ran from 2006-2024, and there is [much to do](/todo/). We'd
welcome your help!
