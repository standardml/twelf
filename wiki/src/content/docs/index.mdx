title: The Twelf Project
---

[Twelf](/wiki/about-the-twelf-project/) is a language used to specify,
implement, and prove properties of deductive systems such as programming
languages and logics. [Large research projects using
Twelf](wiki/research-projects-using-twelf/) include the TALT typed assembly
language, a foundational proof-carrying-code system, and a type safety proof
for Standard ML. Twelf is no longer undergoing active development, but it
retains a community of users and remains a valuable tool for research.

Visitors without a technical background are encouraged to read the [general
description of Twelf](http://twelf.org/wiki/general-description-of-twelf/).

- The [installation instructions](/wiki/download/) can get you started.
- [Proving metatheorems with Twelf](/wiki/proving-metatheorems-with-twelf) is
  a mini-course on some of the most common ways of using Twelf.
- The [glossary](/wiki/glossary/) and [documentation hub](/documentation/)
  are the most up-to-date documentation for Twelf.

This website is home of Twelf language _and_ the home for lots of Twelf-centric
tutorials on logic and programming languages. See the [case studies
hub](/wiki/case-studies/) for more. Don't be shy about

tutorials or case studies!
