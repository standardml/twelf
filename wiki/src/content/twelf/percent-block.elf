%%! title: "%block"

%{! A **``%block``** declaration names a **block**, which is a partial description of an LF context. Blocks are composed into [regular worlds](/wiki/percent-worlds/) with [``%worlds``](/wiki/percent-worlds/) declarations, which describe the complete set of possible contexts for a type family. This description of the context is an important part of the [adequacy](/wiki/adequacy/) of the [metatheorem](/wiki/metatheorem/) established by a [``%total``](/wiki/percent-total/) declaration.

A ``%block`` declaration acts more like a definition than other keywords, which generally cause Twelf to _do_ something rather than _define_ something. The obvious exception to this is [%define](/wiki/define-declaration/).


## Sample ``%block`` declarations

These sample ``%block`` declarations are in the context of the definitions of ``exp`` and ``height`` in the [``%worlds``](/wiki/percent-worlds/) article.

Using this block in a ``%worlds`` declaration means that arbitrary variables representing expressions can appear in the context:
```twelf
%block var-rand : block {x : exp}.
```
Using this block in a ``%worlds`` declaration means that variables representing expressions can appear in the context, but only if they are accompanied by a judgment that defines the height of that variable to be one.
```twelf
%block var-height : block {x : exp}{_ : height x (s z)}.
```
Using this block in a ``%worlds`` declaration means that variables representing expressions can appear in the context, but only if they are accompanied by a judgment that defines the height of that variable to be some natural number.
```twelf
%block var-heightN : some {N: nat} block {x : exp}{_ : height x N}.
```
## Block definitions

As of 1.7.1, block &lt;i&gt;definitions&lt;/i&gt; are now supported. !}%

%{! (options removed from twelftag: import="new") !}%

typ : type.
exp : typ -> type.

%block typ-var : block {a : typ}.
%block exp-var : some {T : typ} block {x : exp T}.
%block vars = (typ-var | exp-var).

%{! Using ``vars`` in a [``%worlds``](/wiki/percent-worlds/) declaration is the same as using ``typ-var | exp-var``, and in fact when Twelf prints out the ``%worlds`` declaration, block definitions will be automatically expanded. !}%

%{! (options removed from twelftag: import="new" check="decl") !}%

%worlds (vars) (exp _).
