%%! title: "Congruence relation"

%{! A congruence relation on a language is an [equivalence relation](/wiki/equivalence-relation/) that is compatible with the term constructors of that language.

Consider the untyped lambda-calculus:

&lt;math&gt;e ::= x \mid \lambda x.\, e \mid e_1\ e_2&lt;/math&gt;

A congruence relation &lt;math&gt;\texttt\{\}e_1 = e_2&lt;/math&gt; must be closed under the equivalence rules,

&lt;math&gt;
  \{\; \over e = e\} \mbox\{refl\} \qquad
  \{ e_1 = e_2 \over e_2 = e_1 \} \mbox\{symm\} \qquad
  \{ e_1 = e_2 \qquad e_2 = e_3 \over e_1 = e_3 \} \mbox\{trans\},
&lt;/math&gt;

and the compatibility rules,

&lt;math&gt;
  \{\; \over x = x\} \qquad
  \{ e_1 = e_2 \over \lambda x.\, e_1 = \lambda x.\, e_2 \} \qquad
  \{ e_1 = e_1' \qquad e_2 = e_2' \over e_1\ e_2 = e_1'\ e_2' \}.
&lt;/math&gt; !}%
