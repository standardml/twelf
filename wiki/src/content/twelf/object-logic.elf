%%! title: "Object logic"

%{! An **object logic** is a logic encoded as an [LF](/wiki/lf/) signature, with the intent of studying it with Twelf. The term "logic" is used very broadly here, as it can refer to any **deductive system** with an [abstract syntax](/wiki/abstract-syntax/) and a set of [relation](/wiki/relation/)s that can be encoded in LF. We use the term **object language** as a synonym.  Examples of object logics include arithmetic over [natural numbers](/wiki/natural-numbers/), a theory of [lists](/wiki/lists/), propositional logic, [linear logic](/wiki/linear-logic/), or programming languages like the [simply-typed lambda calculus](/wiki/simply-typed-lambda-calculus/).  

In general, anything defined using an LF signature is an object logic of some form. The term object logic is used to contrast the logic from the [meta-logic](/wiki/meta-logic/) used to encode  it.
