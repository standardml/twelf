# ``%partial``
If you're interested in a ``%covers`` that "does the right thing" (input, output, freeness, and checking of other type families in subgoals), I have a simple implementation of the ``%partial`` declaration. This declaration does the same thing as ``%total`` but does not perform the totality check. From it you get a "partial correctness" property: a ``%partial`` relation will either search forever or it will succeed. &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;[User:Tom7](/wiki/user-tom7/) 22:41, 17 October 2007 (EDT)
