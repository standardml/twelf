Is there a better way to include the front page text on this page?  They're both serving as portals, so I think the duplication is reasonable: the docs page is the "real" source for the list of intro material, but we happen to have all of it duplicated on the front page for convenience right now.[User:Drl](/wiki/user-drl/) 00:24, 24 October 2006 (EDT)
