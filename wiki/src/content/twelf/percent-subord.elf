%%! title: "%subord"

%{! \{\{undocumented|article\}\}

The **``%subord``** declaration adds edges to the [subordination](/wiki/subordination/) relation.  This declaration is currently only available in Twelf CVS\{\{discuss|Version\}\} and may not yet be available in [TwelfTag](/wiki/twelftag/). 

## Syntax

The syntax is as follows:

``%subord (t1 t1') ... (tn tn').``

The type families ``ti'`` will then be treated as being dependent on the type family ``ti``.

## Example

\{\{needs|a good concise example.\}\}


\{\{keyword|key=subord\}\}

\{\{stub\}\} !}%
