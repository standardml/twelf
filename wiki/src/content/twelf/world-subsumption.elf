%%! title: "World subsumption"

%{!
**World subsumption** is a sufficient condition that a [metatheorem](/wiki/metatheorem/) proved for one set of LF contexts can be reused in another set of contexts.

Eventually, this page will contain a self-contained explanation for world subsumption.  For now, please read the discussion in \{\{proving|title=Proving totality assertions in non-empty contexts\}\} and on the [%worlds](/wiki/percent-worlds/) page.
