%{! Twelf is a research project concerned with the design, implementation, and application of logical frameworks funded by the National Science Foundation under grants CCR-9619584 and CCR-9988281 Meta-Logical Frameworks, CCR-0306313 Efficient Logical Frameworks (Principal Investigator: Frank Pfenning) and by DARPA under the contract number F196268-95-C-0050 The Fox Project: Advanced Languages for Systems Software (Principal Investigators: Robert Harper, Peter Lee, and Frank Pfenning).

The Twelf implementation comprises

*the LF logical framework, including type reconstruction;
*the Elf constraint logic programming language;
*an inductive meta-theorem prover for LF (very preliminary);
*and an Emacs interface.

The principal authors of Twelf are

*[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/ Frank Pfenning], and
*[http://www.itu.dk/people/carsten/ Carsten Sch√ºrmann]

with major contrubtions by

*[http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/ Brigitte Pientka],
* Roberto Virga, and
*[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kw/ Kevin Watkins]

Twelf provides a uniform meta-language for specifying, implementing, and proving properties of programming languages and logics. Example suites include Cartesian Closed Categories and lambda-calculus, the Church-Rosser theorem for the untyped lambda-calculus, Mini-ML including type preservation and compilation, cut elimination, theory of logic programming, and Hilbert's deduction theorem. !}%
