%%! title: "MediaWiki talk:Sidebar"

%{!
Here's my attempt at rationalizing the organization of the sidebar:
* Everything on the wiki should be reachable from the links in the top navigation section.  Right now, this amounts to saying that [documentation](/wiki/documentation/) indexes mostly everything.
* the remaining space above the search box should be used for quick links to things we think people will go to often (right now, the main documentation sections).
