%%! title: "%trustme"

%{! \{\{undocumented\}\} The **``%trustme``** keyword, when it precedes another directive such as a **``%total``** directive, causes Twelf to believe that the directive succeeded even if it did not. This feature is only available in [unsafe mode](/wiki/unsafe-mode/), and can be used to easily create [holes in metatheorems](/wiki/incremental-metatheorem-development/).
