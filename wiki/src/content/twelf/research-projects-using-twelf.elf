%%! title: "Research projects using Twelf"

%{! Please add your research using Twelf to the links below.  We hope this collection of links will encourage collaboration among Twelf users and record how Twelf is being used in practice.  

The links on this page are grouped into two rough categories: larger projects (e.g., a multi-year endeavor) and smaller projects (e.g., some Twelf code that accompanies a research paper).  The line between these two is fuzzy, so add your work wherever you think it fits best. __NOTOC__

## Research using Twelf

#### Larger projects

* [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/projects/pcc/ Proof Carrying Code] - scaling up the idea of Proof Carrying Code to real programming languages, using a logic encoded in Twelf's dependent type system.
* [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~self/ The SeLF Project] - encodings of security policies and proofs of security properties for the [http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~grey/ Grey project].
* [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dklee/tslf/ Mechanizing the Metatheory of Standard ML] - a formalization of Standard ML and verification of its metatheory in Twelf. 
* [http://tom7.org/proposal/ Modal Types for Mobile Code] - [User:Tom7](/wiki/user-tom7/)'s Ph.D. thesis project
* [https://trac.omdoc.org/LATIN LATIN] - a project aimed at the creation of a large library of logics and logic translations supported by a web-scalable infrastructure

#### Smaller projects

* [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~drl/pubs/lh05dmlproofs-tr/lh05dmlproofs-tr.pdf Dependent Types for ML] - A paper by [User:drl](/wiki/user-drl/) and [[User:rwh|Bob Harper]] about enriching an ML-like type system with a form of dependent types.  Much of the metatheory of the language is mechanized in Twelf.  
* [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/fluet/twelf/index.html Substructural Languages] - Twelf code from some of Matthew Fluet's papers on substructural languages.
* [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jdonham/aml-proof/ Self-Adjusting Computation] - [User:JakeD](/wiki/user-jaked/) formalization of a consistency proof of non-deterministic semantics.
* [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~joshuad/papers/intcomp/ Elaborating Intersection and Union Types] — [[User:Joshua|Joshua Dunfield]]'s proofs about an elaboration semantics.
