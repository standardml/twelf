%%! title: "Natural numbers"

%{! The **natural numbers** are the numbers 0, 1, 2, etc. The term is generally used to indicate a specific technique of representing natural numbers as either zero or the successor of some other natural number - 0, s(0), s(s(0)), etc - as in [[w:Peano arithmetic|Peano arithmetic]], a technique also sometimes referred to as **unary numbers.**

## Natural numbers in Twelf

Natural numbers in Twelf are usually defined in a similar way. Mathematically, natural numbers can be defined as zero or the successor of some other natural number:

&lt;math&gt;\texttt\{\}n ::= 0 \,|\, \texttt\{s\}(n)&lt;/math&gt;

This representation translates easily into Twelf: !}%
    
nat: type.
z: nat.
s: nat -> nat.

%{! The first line declares that ``nat`` is a type. The second line declares ``z`` (zero) to be an object of type ``nat``, and the third line declars ``s`` (successor) to be a type constructor that takes an object ``N`` of type ``nat`` and produces another object ``(s N)`` of type ``nat``.

## Addition of natural numbers in Twelf

The addition of these natural numbers is defined by the judgment &lt;math&gt;\texttt\{plus\}(N_1,N_2,N_3)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;N_3&lt;/math&gt; are natural numbers. In the definition below, capital letters stand for metavariables that can range over all natural numbers. 

&lt;math&gt;\{\qquad \over \texttt\{plus\}(0,N,N)\}\{\mbox\{p-z\}\}&lt;/math&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\{\texttt\{plus\}(N_1,N_2,N_3) \over \texttt\{plus\}(\texttt\{s\}(N_1),N_2,\texttt\{s\}(N_3))\}\{\mbox\{p-s\}\}&lt;/math&gt;

These judgments also translate cleanly into Twelf: !}%
    
plus: nat -> nat -> nat -> type.
p-z: plus z N N.
p-s: plus (s N1) N2 (s N3)
      <- plus N1 N2 N3.

%{! The first line defines the judgment, declaring ``plus`` to be a type family indexed by three terms of type ``nat``. 

The second line declares that for any natural number ``N``, ``p-z`` is an object of type ``plus z N N``, which corresponds to the axiom p-z above. The ``N`` is an [implicit parameter](/wiki/implicit-and-explicit-parameters/) - it is treated as a bound variable by Twelf, which you can see by `` check="true"&gt;looking at Twelf's output`` after checking the above code. 

The third line says that ``p-s`` is a type constructor that, given an object ``D`` of type ``plus N1 N2 N3`` (where ``N1``, ``N2``, and ``N3`` are all implicit parameters that can
be treated as metavariables), produces an object, ``p-s D``, with type ``plus (s N1) N2 (s N3)``. This corresponds to the rule p-s, which given a derivation of &lt;math&gt;\texttt\{plus\}(N_1,N_2,N_3)&lt;/math&gt; allows us to conclude &lt;math&gt;\texttt\{plus\}(\texttt\{s\}(N_1),N_2,\texttt\{s\}(N_3))&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider this derivation which encodes the fact that &lt;math&gt;2 + 1 = 3&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; \{\{\{\;\} \over \{
\texttt\{plus\}(0,\;\;\texttt\{s\}(0),\;\;\texttt\{s\}(0))\}\}\{\mbox\{p-z\}\} \over \{\{
\texttt\{plus\}(\texttt\{s\}(0),\;\;\texttt\{s\}(0),\;\;\texttt\{s\}(\texttt\{s\}(0)))\} \over \{
\texttt\{plus\}(\texttt\{s\}(\texttt\{s\}(0)),\;\;\texttt\{s\}(0),\;\;\texttt\{s\}(\texttt\{s\}(\texttt\{s\}(0))))\}\}\{\mbox\{p-s\}\}\}\{\mbox\{p-s\}\} &lt;/math&gt;

This can be represented in Twelf by applying the type constructor ``p-s`` to the object ``p-z`` twice: !}%
    
%{! (options removed from twelftag: check=decl) !}%

2+1=3 : plus (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s z))) = p-s (p-s p-z).
