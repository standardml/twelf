%%! title: "Talk:%theorem"

%{!
This page seems too terse and erroneous too.
%theorem is equivalent to a type family definition and a mode definition
(and much more readable!).
It does NOT include %worlds.
I know that _real_ Twelf users don't ever use it, even
when it would make their meta-theorems much easier to read.
I think this is a shame.  %theorem declarations are 
perfectly compatible with manual theorem proving.
&lt;twelf&gt;
bool : type.


true : bool.

false : bool.


%freeze bool.



eq : bool -&gt; bool -&gt; type.


eq/ : eq B B.



%theorem eq-reflexive : 
        forall \{X\} 
        exists \{E:eq X X\} 
        true.

- : eq-reflexive _ eq/.

%worlds () (eq-reflexive _ _).
%total \{ \} (eq-reflexive _ _).
&lt;/twelf&gt;

The confusion here, I believe, is that %theorem does perform the %worlds job when being used as part of the [theorem prover](/wiki/theorem-prover/), but not when being used in totality-declaration-style. I think the edit here is accurate, if you want to run with it it could use a simple example. â€” [User:rsimmons](/wiki/user-rsimmons/) (and his [User talk:rsimmons](/wiki/user-talk-rsimmons/)) 16:08, 30 January 2008 (EST)
