%{! The following introductory guides are available:

* [Proving metatheorems with Twelf](/wiki/proving-metatheorems-with-twelf/): if you have some background in programming languages but no prior experience with LF and Twelf, start with this introduction.

* [POPL Tutorial](/wiki/popl-tutorial/) 2009: course materials from a Twelf tutorial at POPL 2009.  This path through the material is the best introduction to Twelf, but it may be harder to follow along with online than [Proving metatheorems](/wiki/proving-metatheorems-with-twelf/).

* [Summer school 2008](/wiki/summer-school-2008/): notes from a Twelf course at [http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer08/ the University of Oregon Summer School on Logic and Theorem Proving in Programming Languages, July 2008]

Basic mechanics:

* [Twelf with Emacs](/wiki/twelf-with-emacs/): Using Twelf from within Emacs

* [Twelf without Emacs](/wiki/twelf-without-emacs/): Running the twelf-server directly from the command line.

We plan to add other introductory articles for other audiences.  If you have suggestions, please
