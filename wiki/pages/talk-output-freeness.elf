%%! title: "Talk:Output freeness"

%{! This topic was on the other wiki as well: http://fp.logosphere.cs.cmu.edu/twelf/?n=Answers.Freeness . It's by Geoff Washburn, not me, so if you include a lot from that file you'll need to add a &lt;nowiki&gt;\{\{license-by-sa\}\}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag. â€” [Rob](/wiki/user-rsimmons/) (and his [talk](/wiki/user-talk-rsimmons/)) 16:57, 7 September 2006 (MST)

## How does output coverage differ from output freeness?

That question deserves a thorough answer, but Jason and I came up with this program while screwing around: observe that ``fake-thm`` output covers, even though the subgoal invocation of ``ff`` in the ``ft/z`` case is not "output free" because the output argument is a ground term: !}%
    
nat : type.
s : nat -> nat.
z : nat.

bool : type.
t : bool.
f : bool.

add : nat -> nat -> nat -> type.
%mode add +M +N -O.

add/z : add M z M.
add/s : add M (s N) (s O')
     <- add M N O'.

%worlds () (add _ _ _).
%total N (add _ N _).

boolcont : bool -> type.
@ : {B} boolcont B.

ff : {B : bool} {C : boolcont B} type.
%mode ff +B -C.
- : ff B (@ B).

fake-thm : {M : nat} type.
%mode fake-thm -N.

ft/z : fake-thm z
 <- ff t (@ t).

%worlds () (ff _ _) (fake-thm _).
%total D (ff D _).
%total [] (fake-thm _).
