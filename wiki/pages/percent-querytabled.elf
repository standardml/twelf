%%! title: "%querytabled"

%{! The **``%querytabled``** directive starts a query using Twelf's [tabled logic programming](/wiki/tabled-logic-programming/) engine, so that instances of a type family marked with [``%tabled``](/wiki/percent-tabled/) directive will be derived at most once during proof search. It otherwise looks the same as [``%query``](/wiki/percent-query/).
