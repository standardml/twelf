%%! description: "A %subord declaration directly extends the subordination relation."

%{!
The **``%subord``** declaration adds edges to the [subordination](/wiki/subordination/) relation. 

## Syntax

The syntax is as follows:

```
%subord (t1 t1') ... (tn tn').
```

The type families ``ti'`` will then be treated as being dependent on the type family ``ti``.
