%%! title: "%theorem"

%{! The **``%theorem``** declaration acts as the _specification_ of a theorem.

\{\{needs|syntax of the declaration\}\}

## Use to write statements of metatheorems

Some people find the notation a clearer way of specifying [metatheorems](/wiki/metatheorem/); a ``%theorem`` declaration used in this style handles the type family declation and the [``%mode``](/wiki/percent-mode/) declaration parts of a [totality assertion](/wiki/totality-assertion/).

## Use with the theorem prover

When using the Twelf [theorem prover](/wiki/theorem-prover/), a ``%theorem`` declaration establishes a proposition that the theorem prover may later attempt to establish. A **``%theorem``** declaration is thus somewhat analogous to the three-part specification of a [totality assertions](/wiki/totality-assertion/), the type family definition, the [%mode](/wiki/percent-mode/) declaration, and the [%worlds](/wiki/percent-worlds/) declaration.
