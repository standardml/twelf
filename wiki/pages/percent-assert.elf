%%! title: "%assert"

%{! The **``%assert``** directive instructs the [theorem prover](/wiki/theorem-prover/) to accept a previously stated theorem as true without trying to prove that theorem. This directive is thus analogous to a ``[%trustme](/wiki/percent-trustme/)&nbsp;[%total](/wiki/percent-total/)`` directive. Because it instructs Twelf to treat something as true without a proof, Twelf must be in [unsafe mode](/wiki/unsafe-mode/) to use this directive.

## Example

The example from the [theorem prover](/wiki/theorem-prover/) article can be modified to use ``%assert`` instead of ``%prove`` for the two lemmas that are needed to establish the commutativity of addition (this example cannot be run on the wiki, which uses Twelf in safe mode). !}%
