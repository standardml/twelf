%%! title: "User:DanielKLee"

%{! 2nd (as of Fall 2006) year PhD student at CMU. More info at [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dklee my homepage]. I'm lucky enough that my research heavily involves formalization and metatheorem proving in Twelf. Among other things, I try to contribute interesting/advanced examples to the Twelf wiki. With the help of the other wiki elves, these examples become informative _and_ human consumable. I've seen and fought a number of strange and challenging Twelf metatheorem proving related beasts in my travels, so if you've got questions or requests make a note in [User talk:DanielKLee](/wiki/user-talk-danielklee/) or [The Twelf Project: To do](/wiki/the-twelf-project-to-do/). !}%
