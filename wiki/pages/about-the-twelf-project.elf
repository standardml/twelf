%{! Twelf is a research project concerned with the design, implementation, and
application of logical frameworks funded by the National Science Foundation
under grants CCR-9619584 and CCR-9988281 Meta-Logical Frameworks, CCR-0306313
Efficient Logical Frameworks (Principal Investigator: Frank Pfenning) and by
DARPA under the contract number F196268-95-C-0050 The Fox Project: Advanced
Languages for Systems Software (Principal Investigators: Robert Harper, Peter
Lee, and Frank Pfenning).

The Twelf implementation comprises

- the LF logical framework, including type reconstruction;
- the Elf constraint logic programming language;
- an inductive meta-theorem prover for LF (very preliminary);
- and an Emacs interface.

The principal authors of Twelf are

- [Frank Pfenning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/), and
- [Carsten Sch√ºrmann](http://www.itu.dk/people/carsten)

with major contributions by

- [Brigitte Pientka](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/),
- Roberto Virga, and
- Kevin Watkins

Twelf provides a uniform meta-language for specifying, implementing, and proving properties of programming languages and logics. Example suites include Cartesian Closed Categories and lambda-calculus, the Church-Rosser theorem for the untyped lambda-calculus, Mini-ML including type preservation and compilation, cut elimination, theory of logic programming, and Hilbert's deduction theorem.
