%%! title: "Beta-equivalence"

%{! **Beta-equivalence** (Î²-equivalence) is a notion of proof equivalence in natural deduction logics with introduction and elimination forms.  Roughly, it says that when an elimination form is applied to an introduction form, they cancel.

Consider the simply-typed lambda-calculus with arrow types.

<DisplayMath formula="A ::= a \mid A_1 \rightarrow A_2"/>

<DisplayMath formula="e ::= x \mid \lambda x{:}A.\, e \mid e_1\ e_2"/>

The beta-equivalence induced by the arrow type <Math formula="A \rightarrow B"/> says that the elimination form <Math formula="e_1\ e_2"/> "cancels" the introduction form <Math formula="\lambda x{:}A.\, e"/>; formally, it is the least [congruence relation](/wiki/congruence-relation/) <Math formula="\texttt{}e_1 =_\beta e_2"/> closed under the <Math formula="\texttt{}\beta"/> axiom:

<DisplayMath formula="{\; \over (\lambda x{:}A.\, e_1)\ e_2 =_\beta [e_2/x] e_1} \beta"/>

Beta-equivalence is usually oriented to the right yielding a notion of _beta-reduction_.  For example:

<DisplayMath formula="(\lambda x{:}A.\, e_1)\ e_2 \Longrightarrow_\beta [e_2/x] e_1"/>

The term on the left-hand side of the <Math formula="\texttt{}\beta"/> axiom is called a _beta-redex_, and the term on the right-hand side is its _beta-reduct_.  A term with no beta-redexes is called _beta-normal_.  Being beta-normal is one aspect of being [canonical](/wiki/canonical-form/). !}%
