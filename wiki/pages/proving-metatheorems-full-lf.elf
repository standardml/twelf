_This page is part of the introduction to [proving metatheorems with Twelf](/wiki/proving-metatheorems-with-twelf/)._

In the [previous section](/wiki/proving-metatheorems-representing-the-judgements-of-the-natural-numbers/), we saw how dependently-typed LF can be used to represent object-language judgements. We now discuss dependently-typed LF in more detail.

## Definition of LF

Full LF has the following syntax:

```math
\begin{align*}
K & ::= \mathtt{type} \mid \Pi x{:}A. K 
\\
A & ::= b \mid A \, M \mid \Pi x{:}A_1. A_2 
\\
R & ::= c \mid x \mid R \, M 
\\
M & ::= R \mid \lambda x. M
\end{align*}
```

In Twelf's concrete syntax, the type <Math formula="\Pi x{:}A_1 .A_2"/> is written ``{x:A1} A2``, the kind <Math formula="\Pi x{:}A .K"/> is written ``{x:A} K``, and the term <Math formula="\lambda x.M"/> is written ``[x] M``.  The terms are unchanged from the previous grammar.  The type families now include both dependent function types and applications <Math formula="A \, M"/> of type families to terms.  The kind level classifies type families. Type families of kind <Math formula="\mathtt{type}"/> classify terms. Type families that are not yet fully instantiated have kinds ``{x:A} K``.  In both types and kinds, we use ``->`` as an abbreviation when the argument is not free in the result.  

For example, in the previous section, we declared the type family ``plus`` to have kind ``nat -> nat -> nat -> type``.  This means that when  ``plus`` is applied to three terms of type ``nat``, it forms a type.  This kind is syntactic sugar for the kind ``{_:nat} {_:nat} {_:nat} type``.  The partial application ``plus z`` has kind ``nat -> nat -> type``.  Below, we will see examples where the type of one index of a type family depends on a previous argument, which motivates permitting general ``{x:A} K`` kinds in the general case.

We do not present the typing rules for LF in detail here.  However, we do call attention to the typing rule for application.  In a dependently typed language, the application typing rules must substitute the argument into the body of the dependent function type:

```math
R : \Pi x {:} A. B \qquad M : A \over R \; M : [M/x]B
```

In LF, this substitution <Math formula="[M/x]B"/> is in fact a [hereditary substitution](/wiki/hereditary-substitution/), ensuring that the terms embedded in the result of the substitution are in canonical form.  

This typing rule is how constants representing inference rules are specialized to particular instances.  For example, constant ``even-s`` from the previous section has type ``{N:nat} even N ->; even (s (s N))``, so the application ``even-s z`` has type ``even z -> even (s (s z))``.

The typing rule for family applications <Math formula="A\,M"/> has a similar substitution into the result kind.

```math
A : \Pi x {:} B. K \qquad M : B \over A \; M : [M/x]K
```


## Twelf conveniences

Twelf permits several syntactic conveniences for writing LF signatures.  The purpose of this list is to introduce you to these conveniences;  we will see examples of them later in this introduction or elsewhere on the wiki.

### Definitions

In Twelf, you can define an LF constant for later use.  For example assuming the [last section's definition of natural numbers](/wiki/proving-metatheorems-representing-the-judgements-of-the-natural-numbers/), we can write this: !}%
    
%{!! begin hidden !!}%
nat : type.
z   : nat.
s   : nat -> nat.

even    : nat -> type.
even-z  : even z.
even-s  : {N:nat} even N -> even (s (s N)).

plus : nat -> nat -> nat -> type.
%{!! end hidden !!}%

%{!! begin checked !!}%
2 : nat = s (s z).
even-2 : even 2 = even-s z even-z.
%{!! end checked !!}%

%{! The first constant names a natural number ``2``; the second names a derivation that ``2`` is even. (Twelf treats numeric identifiers the same as any other constants as long as no [constraint domains](/wiki/constraint-domain/) are active, so naming a constant `2` is no different, from Twelf's perspective, than naming it `two`.)

You can name terms of higher type as well: !}%

%{!! begin checked !!}%
ss : nat -> nat = [x:nat] s (s x).
%{!! end checked !!}%

%{! This constant might be used as follows: !}%

%{!! begin checked !!}%
even-4 : even (ss 2) = even-s 2 even-2.
%{!! end checked !!}%

%{! Definitions like this do not create any new numbers (i.e. any new canonical forms of type `nat`), they just name what can be formed with existing constants. 

### Non-canonical forms

Twelf permits non-canonical forms, which are treated as syntactic sugar for the associated canonical form.  Here are some examples:

#### [Beta-equivalence](/wiki/beta-equivalence/)

The term ``ss 2``, which, if we expand the definitions, reads ``([x] (s (s x))) (s (s z))``, has the canonical form ``s (s (s (s z)))``. So we might expect Twelf to automatically expand that definition in its output: !}%

%{!! begin checked !!}%
four = ss 2.
%{!! end checked !!}%

%{!
The expected expansion doesn't actually happen! Twelf works very hard _not_ to expand definitions, while still always returning the same results as if those definitions had been expanded. For all purposes `ss 2` should be thought of as another way of writing the `s (s (s (s z)))`.

#### [Eta-equivalence](/wiki/eta-equivalence/)

The term ``s``, which has type ``nat ->; nat`` can be used instead of its eta-expansion ``[x] s x``. Eta expansions will always be performed in Twelf's output: !}%

%{!! begin checked !!}%
other-s = s.
%{!! end checked !!}%

%{!
We will discuss eta-equivalence more in the context of [higher-order representations.](/wiki/proving-metatheorems-representing-the-judgements-of-the-stlc/)

### Implicit arguments

Writing out all of the parameters to a constant becomes tedious, so Twelf permits these parameters to be left implicit.  Specifically, if a variable starting with a lower-case letter is left unbound in a constant's type, Twelf reports an error.  If a variable beginning with an upper-case letter is left unbound, Twelf implicitly binds it in a ``\{N\}`` at the outside of the type.  For example, the following two ways of declaring the constant ``plus-s`` give it the same type:

```twelf    
%% explicit
plus-s : {N1:nat} {N2:nat} {N3:nat} plus N1 N2 N3 -> plus (s N1) N2 (s N3).
%% implicit
plus-s : plus N1 N2 N3 -> plus (s N1) N2 (s N3).
```

Similarly, we can make the parameter to ``plus-z`` implicit:
    
```twelf
%%explicit
plus-z : {N2:nat} plus z N2 N2.
%%implicit
plus-z : plus z N2 N2.
```

In most circumstances, Twelf can infer the types of the implicit parameters from their use in the constant's type.  If it cannot, it reports an error---the type of a constant must be fully determined when the constant is processed.

The application of a constant to its implicit parameters is then inferred from context.  For example, using the fully explicit definition of ``plus``, the derivation that 2 + 1 = 3 is written as follows: !}%

%{!! begin hidden !!}%
plus-z : {N2} plus z N2 N2.
plus-s : {N1:nat} {N2:nat} {N3:nat} plus N1 N2 N3 -> plus (s N1) N2 (s N3).
%{!! end hidden !!}%

%{!! begin checked !!}%
d2+1e = plus-s (s z) (s z) (s (s z)) 
        (plus-s z (s z) (s z) 
                (plus-z (s z))).
%{!! end checked !!}%

%{! Using the implicit version, it is much shorter: !}%

%{!! begin hidden !!}%
plus-z : plus z N2 N2.
plus-s : plus N1 N2 N3 -> plus (s N1) N2 (s N3).
%{!! end hidden !!}%

%{!! begin checked !!}%
d2+1i = plus-s (plus-s plus-z).
%{!! end checked !!}%

%{! The type of this term is ambiguous, but Twelf will attempt to use [unification](/wiki/unification/) to infer the most general possible type.

### Backwards arrow

Twelf permits a type ``A -&gt; B`` to be written ``B &lt;- A``.  This makes it easier to see the result of applying a constant to all of its arguments.  For example: !}%
    
%{! (options removed from twelftag: discard="true") !}%

plus-s : plus (s N1) N2 (s N3)
           <- plus N1 N2 N3.

%{! When we write ``C &lt;- Pn &lt;- ... P1``, we will refer to ``C`` as the _conclusion_ of the constant and each ``Pi`` as a _premise_, by analogy with the terminology for the inference rule that this constant represents.  

The backwards-arrow also has implications on the logic programming operational semantics for LF, as we discuss below; the conclusion/premise terminology is consistent with the use of these words in logic programming as well.

### Type and term inference

Twelf permits type annotations, which are written ``M:A``, on all terms.  Type annotations can be used for documentation.  Additionally, in some cases they are necessary to help guide type inference.  We can also use a type annotation to determine the type of an implicit parameter: !}%
    
d2+1i' = plus-s (plus-s (plus-z : plus z (s z) (s z))).

%{! This term unambiguously has type ``plus (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s z)))``

Type annotations on the arguments of lambda-terms ``[x:A] M`` are sometimes necessary, but they can often be elided.  Type annotations on Pi-types ``\{x:A2\} A`` can sometimes be elided when the type of the variable is determined by its use.

When they are determined from context, terms can be elided by writing an underscore.  For example, if the constants defining ``plus`` were declared with explicit ``nat`` parameters, we could still write the derivation of 2+1=3 as follows: !}%

%{!! begin hidden !!}%
plus-z : {N2} plus z N2 N2.
plus-s : {N1:nat} {N2:nat} {N3:nat} plus N1 N2 N3 -> plus (s N1) N2 (s N3).
%{!! end hidden !!}%

d2+1e' = plus-s _ _ _ (plus-s _ _ _ (plus-z (s z))).
