%%! title: "Bibliography of LF"

%{! \{\{needswork|The links haven't all been taken over from the [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~twelf/elf-bib.html old page], and after that happens, they should be tested as many are dead links.\}\}

This is a bibliography collected by Frank Pfenning on the LF logical framework, the logic programming language Elf which is based on LF, and the Twelf meta-logical framework (which includes an implementation of Elf). It is a selection of papers from a more general bibliography on logical frameworks. Papers with known URLs in the World-Wide Web have been annotated with their location and can be previewed or retrieved directly. Corrections, additions, and new URL's for papers and implementations are welcome.
