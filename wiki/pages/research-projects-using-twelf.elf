Please add your research using Twelf to the links below.  We hope this
collection of links will encourage collaboration among Twelf users and record
how Twelf is being used in practice.  

The links on this page are grouped into two rough categories: larger projects
(e.g., a multi-year endeavor) and smaller projects (e.g., some Twelf code that
accompanies a research paper).  The line between these two is fuzzy, so add
your work wherever you think it fits best.

## Research using Twelf

### Larger projects

- [Proof Carrying Code](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/projects/pcc/) - scaling up the idea of Proof Carrying Code to real programming languages, using a logic encoded in Twelf's dependent type system.
* [The SeLF Project](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~self/) - encodings of security policies and proofs of security properties for the [Grey project](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~grey/).
* [Mechanizing the Metatheory of Standard ML](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dklee/tslf/) - a formalization of Standard ML and verification of its metatheory in Twelf. 
* [Modal Types for Mobile Code](http://tom7.org/proposal/) - [Tom](/wiki/user-tom7/)'s Ph.D. thesis project
* [LATIN](https://web.archive.org/web/20150316072122/https://trac.omdoc.org/LATIN/) - a project aimed at the creation of a large library of logics and logic translations supported by a web-scalable infrastructure

### Smaller projects

* [Dependent Types for ML](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~drl/pubs/lh05dmlproofs-tr/lh05dmlproofs-tr.pdf) - A paper by [Dan Licata](/wiki/user-drl/) and Bob Harper about enriching an ML-like type system with a form of dependent types.  Much of the metatheory of the language is mechanized in Twelf.  
* [Substructural Languages](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/fluet/twelf/index.html) - Twelf code from some of Matthew Fluet's papers on substructural languages.
* [Self-Adjusting Computation](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jdonham/aml-proof/) - [Jake Donham's](/wiki/user-jaked/) formalization of a consistency proof of non-deterministic semantics.
* [Elaborating Intersection and Union Types](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5386) â€” Jana Dunfield's proofs about an elaboration semantics.

## Related projects

* [The POPLmark Challenge](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~plclub/poplmark/cmu.html) - A project aimed at increasing the overall use of theorem provers like Twelf in programming language design. A solution to the full challenge using Twelf submitted by a team at CMU [http://fling-l.seas.upenn.edu/~plclub/cgi-bin/poplmark/index.php?title=Submission_from_Carnegie_Mellon].
* [Delphin](http://delphin.poswolsky.com/) - An integration of concepts from Twelf and functional programming languages.
* [Elf](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012232336/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/elf.html) - The predecessor to Twelf.
