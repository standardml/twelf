This is a primitive typechecker for LF.
To use:


Load the SML files:

- CM.make "sources.cm"; 

Load the Twelf files:

- Twelf.make "examples/sources.cfg"; 

Typecheck the signature

- val sgn = Translate.translate_signature();

To use the signature, you can look things up, or
turn it into an array:

- SpineLF.Sgn.array sgn;
