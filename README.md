Twelf is an implementation of

 - the LF logical framework, including type reconstruction
 - the Elf constraint logic programming language
 - a meta-theorem prover for LF (very preliminary)
 - a set of expansion modules to deal natively with numbers and strings
 - an Emacs interface

Installing
==========

For complete installation instructions, see http://twelf.org/

Twelf can be compiled and installed under Unix, either as a separate
"Twelf Server" intended primarily as an inferior process to Emacs, or as
a structure Twelf embedded in Standard ML.

To build with SML of New Jersey type "make smlnj." To build with MLton type
"make mlton." If you are building Twelf through SML of New Jersey, you may need
to run "make buildid" first.
